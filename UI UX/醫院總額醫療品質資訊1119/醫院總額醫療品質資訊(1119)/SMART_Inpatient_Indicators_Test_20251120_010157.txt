- ATC J01: Systemic antibacterials

Joint Replacement Complications:
- 90-day surveillance period
- Deep infection: T84.84, T84.50
- Excludes same-day removal procedures

Readmission Quality:
- 14-day readmission window
- Related diagnosis required
- Excludes planned procedures

Mortality Indicators:

- Hospice services: NHI codes 05601K-05374C
- Home hospice and shared care

========================================
DATA QUALITY NOTES
========================================

Test Server Limitations:
1. Limited surgical procedure coding
2. Incomplete ICD-10-CM/PCS mappings
3. No mortality status in test data
4. Missing readmission linkages
5. Limited hospice service codes

For Production Use:
1. Verify all ICD-10-PCS procedure codes
2. Ensure complete diagnosis code mappings
3. Link Patient mortality from vital statistics
4. Implement 14/30/90-day tracking windows
5. Map NHI procedure codes to FHIR
6. Validate DRG grouper integration

========================================
QUALITY METRICS FORMULAS
========================================

Cesarean Rate = (Cesarean Deliveries / Total Deliveries) ? 100

Clean Surgery Antibiotic >3 Days = 
  (Antibiotic Use >3 Days / Clean Surgeries) ? 100

ESWL Average = Total ESWL Procedures / Unique Patients

14-Day Readmission Rate = 
  (Readmissions ??4 Days / Index Discharges) ? 100

90-Day Infection Rate = 
  (Deep Infections ??0 Days / Joint Replacements) ? 100

AMI Mortality Rate = (AMI Deaths / AMI Admissions) ? 100

Hospice Utilization = 
  (Dementia with Hospice / All Dementia Patients) ? 100

========================================
NEXT STEPS
========================================

1. Connect Hospital Server: Replace with production FHIR endpoint
2. ICD-10 Mapping: Complete all surgical and diagnosis codes
3. Temporal Tracking: Implement readmission/infection windows
4. Mortality Data: Link to vital statistics registry
5. DRG Integration: Connect to TW-DRG grouper
6. NHI Codes: Map all Taiwan NHI procedure codes
7. Quality Reports: Generate quarterly quality metrics
8. Benchmarking: Compare against national averages
