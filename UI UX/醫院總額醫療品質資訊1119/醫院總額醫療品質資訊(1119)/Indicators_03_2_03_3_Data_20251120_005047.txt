| Metric                    | Indicator 03-2 | Indicator 03-3 |
|---------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| ATC Code                  | C10            | A10            |
| Drug Category             | Lipid-Lowering | Antidiabetic   |

| Unique Patients           | 0           | 0           |
| Average per Quarter       | 0          | 0          |


========================================
OVERLAP CALCULATION METHODOLOGY
========================================

For both indicators, the overlap rate is calculated as:

Numerator: Sum of overlapping medication days where:
  - Same hospital ID
  - Same patient ID
  - Different prescription IDs
  - Medication start/end dates overlap
  - Allow zero-day early refill

Denominator: Total medication days for all prescriptions

Formula:
  Overlap Rate (%) = (Overlapping Days / Total Days) x 100

Example:
  Prescription A: 2024-01-01 to 2024-01-30 (30 days)
  Prescription B: 2024-01-15 to 2024-02-14 (31 days)
  Overlap: 2024-01-15 to 2024-01-30 (16 days)
  Total Days: 30 + 31 = 61 days
  Overlap Rate: (16 / 61) x 100 = 26.23%


========================================
DATA QUALITY NOTES
========================================

Test Server Limitations:
1. Limited patient linkage across prescriptions
2. No hospital organization assignments
3. Medication dates may not reflect real patterns
4. ATC codes may be incomplete

For Production Use:
1. Connect to hospital FHIR server with real data
2. Ensure proper patient identifiers (MRN)
3. Verify organization IDs for hospital assignment
4. Validate ATC code mappings
5. Check medication dispense dates vs prescribed dates


========================================
FHIR RESOURCE QUERIES USED
========================================

Query 1: MedicationRequest with date filter
GET https://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/MedicationRequest?

Query 2: Filter by ATC Code (Post-processing)
- C10*: Lipid-lowering agents (Indicator 03-2)
- A10*: Antidiabetic drugs (Indicator 03-3)

Query 3: Extract Patient References
- MedicationRequest.subject.reference

Query 4: Calculate Overlaps (Requires)
- MedicationRequest.authoredOn (prescription date)
- MedicationRequest.dispenseRequest.validityPeriod
- MedicationRequest.dosageInstruction.timing
